**Calculator GUI**
-----------------

"The simplest way to calculate, made easy!"

**üìñ Description**
===============

The Calculator GUI project is a Java-based desktop application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to input mathematical expressions and retrieve the results. The project is structured into three main components: the GUI, the Service, and the Constants.

The GUI component is responsible for rendering the application's user interface, including text fields, buttons, and labels. The Service component handles the actual calculations, while the Constants component provides a centralized location for storing application configurations and constants.

**‚ú® Features**
=============

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features a simple and intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to input mathematical expressions and retrieve the results.
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The application supports basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes in case of invalid input or unexpected errors.
4. **Configurable Application Size**: The application's size can be customized using the `APP_SIZE` constant in the `CommonConstants` class.
5. **Separation of Concerns**: The application is structured into three main components, allowing for better maintainability and scalability.
6. **Reusability**: The application's components are designed to be reusable in other projects, making it a versatile tool for developers.
7. **Platform Independence**: The application is built using Java, making it platform-independent and compatible with most operating systems.
8. **Extensibility**: The application's architecture is designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality as needed.
